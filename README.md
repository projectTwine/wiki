# General
* Build as little tech as possible.

# Language
* Twine - One learning path
* Thread - A resource. Twines consist of multiple threads.
* Forks (Pending) - A fork indicates a point in a twine where learners seem to face questions that need to be answered. There are multiple ways to resolve this, by pointing to multiple threads that may resolve common follow-ups.
* Edges (Graphs) - Relation between two threads.

##Sizable Steps
We need to find a way to deliver the right resources to the right people at the right time.
This is going to have to be an incredible design and data driven problem.

# Projects
##The Web Platform
The web platform is obviously the crux of twine. 

##HotPocket
HotPocket might be the go-to solution to generate and help curate content. Even before creating any 
complex ML projects, we can manually curate courses by using HotPocket while retaining data and tags
that we can use for automation of curation in the future.

# Extensions
##Filling in Gaps
With enough data on where learners are diverging off course or are unable to progress, we'll be able
to find better material to fill those gaps, or better yet produce the content needed to fill particular gaps.


# Infrastructure 
* Trello boards for hypotheses and project-specific backlogs
* Slack for chatting
* Chat logs persisted on GDrive
* Wiki Repo for notes
