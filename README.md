# General
* Build as little tech as possible.

# Language
* Twine - One learning path
* Thread - A resource. Twines consist of multiple threads.
* Forks (Pending) - A fork indicates a point in a twine where learners seem to face questions that need to be answered. There are multiple ways to resolve this, by pointing to multiple threads that may resolve common follow-ups.
* Edges (Graphs) - Relation between two threads.

# Architecture
###Microservices
* Databases
  * Knowledge Graph - What does a resource tell us about a user? (Degreed) What does a resource tell us about itself? What resources are missing? What is the shortest path to a goal? What is the most elaborate path? Has this been taught before? 
  * Relational
* Web Twine Platform - As a teacher, I'd like to not reteach topics and instead use resources already available on the web. How can I aggregate these resources into a course?
* Search Engine - MOOC - What is the Best Resource for a topic? (Class-central 2 levels) 
* Video analysis pipeline - Powers the search engine and more
* Hot Pocket (pending) - As an employee, I'd like to add resources to the knowledge graph as I process them because I learn better than a machine will for the next decade or so.
* School - Supply content

everything we're thinking, think, learning learned during this process
##Sizable Steps
We need to find a way to deliver the right resources to the right people at the right time.
This is going to have to be an incredible design and data driven problem.

# Projects
##The Web Platform
The web platform is obviously the crux of twine. 

##HotPocket
HotPocket might be the go-to solution to generate and help curate content. Even before creating any 
complex ML projects, we can manually curate courses by using HotPocket while retaining data and tags
that we can use for automation of curation in the future.

# Extensions
##Filling in Gaps
With enough data on where learners are diverging off course or are unable to progress, we'll be able
to find better material to fill those gaps, or better yet produce the content needed to fill particular gaps.


# Infrastructure 
* Trello boards for hypotheses, anything NOT built yet or not finalized to be built, and project-specific backlogs
* Slack for chatting
* Chat logs persisted on GDrive
* Wiki Repo for notes


#Notes on Education
1. free K-12 is an option
2. free needs-based higher-ed is an option.
3. the only available market is post-college or to tap into and integrate with k-12 + higher-ed
Perhaps, we tackle, how we enhance the teacher so that they dont have to go into a lecture.
