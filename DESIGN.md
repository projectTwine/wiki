#Typeface 
* Everything is based off the type
* 16px body copy (https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/10/16-pixels-body-copy-anything-less-costly-mistake/)
* 12.36px is the other font-size derived from 20 * goldenratio inverse 
* We use the golden ratio to find font-sizes below and above. (or is it perfect fourths)

font sizes: Font Sizes:16, 21.28, 28.32

#Columns
* Designs are based off a 1280x800 design  
* 12-column layout, 55px (variable) columns, 55px left-right margins, 30px (constant) gutters (based off bootstrap)

#Components
Sections should be divided by the card-format. 
This makes it easy for developers to easily distinguish between components when building in React
