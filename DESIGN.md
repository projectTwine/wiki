#Typeface 
* Everything is based off the type.
* 20 px is the default.
* 12.36 is the other font-size.
* We use the golden ratio to find font-sizes below and above.

#Columns
* Designs are based off a 1280x800 design  
* 12-column layout, 55px columns, 55px left-right margins, 30px gutters (based off bootstrap)

#Components
Sections should be divided by the card-format. 
This makes it easy for developers to easily distinguish between components when building in React
