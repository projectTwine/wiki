Trend is for individual teachers online to move towards paywalls
Udemy is an individual problem on surfacing good courses with people without a large following already
Look at competitors
Digital nomad movement -- teaching as a viable stream of income -- distinguishing factors become quality of teachers and quality of education

Video creation


Target market:
For learners, by learners. Construct learning curves.



What happens if we reverse the problem?
Instead of going from
get all educational videos -> teachers  
and instead  
went
teachers -> videos  
we no longer have to deal with the filtering problem. There's a high chance that a video that has a teacher is educational at this point.
Just by reversing the many->one relationship we can get a much smoother workflow and close the data collection pipeline prototype much earlier.

#Algorithms
When you think about the front-end of Twine, there's a lot of interesting mechanisms at play.
If we propose that a Twine be an "optimal sequencing" then crowd-sourced inputs can be potential ways to further improve the current sequencing. Designate the current Twine T to become optimal overtime by trying a large number of combinations of links and sequences to get to the optimal version.

Thus, the curators should be computer-aided so that we know what sequences do and do not work. Nevertheless, by trying out each link we get more and more data to help others also make optimal sequences.
