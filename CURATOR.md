as a curator&teacher I have the following question:
1. how do I ensure that the videos in the twine are the best of their kind?
2. how do I ensure that I am curating for & to a particular audience?
3. if i'm going to create a resource -- i want to ask... Has it been taught before? If so, how successfully?

##solutions
set watchers on all resources that are related.
we seep in related resources into a database and whenever a video has tags that are oddly similar we review them
